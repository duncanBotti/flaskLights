This is a web app to allow me to use a Raspberry Pi to host a mobile responsive web application. 

The purpose of this project is two fold. 

1. To work with Twitter Bootstrap to create a mobile responsive front end that communicates to a backend Flask application
2. To build a small ci/cd pipeline using a cron job so that when I commit code to the master branch from another computer the raspberry pi will pull the latest code
